## Conceptual and Logical Architecture



### Conceptual Architecture

A conceptual architecture diagram is a high-level visual representation of the structure and components of a system or application. It typically shows the major components, their relationships, and how they interact with each other. Conceptual architecture diagrams are often used to communicate the overall structure of a system to stakeholders and other interested parties. A conceptual architecture diagram can help stakeholders understand the overall structure of a system and the relationships between its components. It can also serve as a starting point for more detailed design and planning activities.

### Logical Architecture

A logical architecture diagram is a visual representation of the logical components, data flows, and interactions of a system or application. It focuses on the functional components of the system rather than the physical components. A logical architecture diagram is used to describe the structure and behavior of a system or application and is typically created during the early stages of system design.
